# Azure Event Hubs For Developers

Files from the LinkedIn Learning course called "Azure Event Hubs for Developers". In this course, the instructor shows how to create, send and manipulate data using the Azure Event Hubs resource on Microsoft Azure, using the C# programming language. 

Differently from the course, I show how to perform the same operations using different methods (azcli, Python, and Terraform). I also provide a docker image with all the needed resources to have fun with azure event hubs.

Here is the [link to the course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/azure-event-hubs-for-developers]).
