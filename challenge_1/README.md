# Challenge #1

The first assignment/challenge of this course is to set up an Event Hubs namespace with the following parameters:

* Pricing tier - Standard Tier
* Namespace with 4 Throughput Units (TU)
* One event hub with default settings

Here, I solve this challenge using different approaches, such as: az cli, Terraform, and Python.
